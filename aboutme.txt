Hi, I'm Nicolas, and I am an undergraduate Physics and 
Data Science student at the University of Florida. 
I enjoy solving problems by using mathematics to 
make inferences off large datasets.
I enjoy studying artificial intelligence functions, 
 population-level patterns, physics, and human behavior.
I have contributed to projects that focus on
accessibility, data collection, and prediction. 
When I'm not developing my skills, I do weightlifting, 
go out for runs, go on trails, connect with friends, 
and read scientific literature.
